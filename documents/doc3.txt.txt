The Denial of Death by Ernest Becker argues that the basis of human civilization is our desire to ignore our mortality. The book contends that death anxiety is the fundamental driver of human life and activity throughout history. The deepest human need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation, but it is life itself which awakens this anxiety.

Becker proposes that people create immortality projects to cope with death anxiety. Some create lasting works like novels or temples. Others have children and create legacies. Many turn to religion for comfort. Our activities, personality traits, and lifestyle choices result from this ever-simmering fear of death.

Those who cannot process death anxiety through immortality projects often turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms or petty distractions. Modern times present problems because traditional systems of immortality have broken down. Old religions with their promises of afterlife no longer hold the same power in the age of reason.

Man is not helped by more knowing but only by living and doing in a partly self-forgetful way. We must plunge into experience and then reflect on its meaning. All reflection and no plunging drives us mad. All plunging and no reflection makes us brutes. The book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1974 shortly after Becker's death, creating its own kind of immortality project.
