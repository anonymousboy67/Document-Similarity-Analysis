Mindset by Carol Dweck details research on implicit theories of intelligence and introduces the concepts of growth and fixed mindsets. People fall into two mindsets regarding their abilities and intelligence. Some believe their abilities are fixed with little room for improvement. Others feel their abilities can improve with time and effort, which is the growth mindset.

People with growth mindsets view hard work, resilience, and determination as virtues. Failure is not a danger to their sense of self but rather a learning experience. The passion for stretching yourself and sticking to it even when things are not going well is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This mindset allows people to thrive during challenging times.

Why waste time proving how great you are when you could be getting better? Why hide deficiencies instead of overcoming them? Why look for friends who only shore up your self-esteem instead of ones who challenge you to grow? Why seek the tried and true instead of experiences that will stretch you?

The book applies primarily to education but its lessons extend to many areas of life. Not everything about you was set at birth. If you maintain a growth mindset, things can change throughout your life. Becoming is better than being. Personal development and continuous learning lead to fuller enjoyment of life. People can develop their abilities through dedication and hard work rather than viewing talent as innate and unchangeable.
