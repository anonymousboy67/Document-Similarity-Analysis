Being Mortal by Atul Gawande examines how doctors and society approach aging and death. The book argues that the medical field overemphasizes survival at the expense of patients' well-being and quality of life. Our ultimate goal after all is not a good death but a good life to the very end.

Gawande discusses how people view their lives as stories rather than just average moments. For human beings life is meaningful because it is a story. A story has a sense of wholeness and its arc is determined by significant moments where something happens. The book delves into the history of age-related care and philosophizes over mortality.

The author examines different kinds of end-of-life care and discusses the comparative advantages of hospice care. He explores how we approach our shared fate of death and aging. The medical profession must balance extending life with maintaining dignity and quality of living.

Everyone will die one day and how we live our lives with that understanding varies considerably. The book offers thoughts on how we might do better as we inevitably age. It challenges readers to think about what makes life worth living even as our bodies fail us. Gawande emphasizes that maintaining autonomy and purpose matters more than simply extending biological existence.
