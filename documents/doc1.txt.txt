Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl explores finding purpose in life through suffering and survival. The book recounts Frankl's experiences as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps and his observations of human psychology under extreme conditions. He focuses on how prisoners who had purpose or something to look forward to were more likely to survive the ordeals.

Frankl introduces logotherapy, a school of psychotherapy based on the need for people to have meaning and purpose in their lives. He argues that meaning is the primary motivator for human beings. We must have a reason to endure hardship and suffering. When people have a why they can endure any how.

The book demonstrates that there are two races of men in this world: the race of decent people and the race of indecent people. Finding purpose in one's life is arguably the most potent means of personal transformation and survival. Those who lack purpose lose their spiritual hold and decline mentally and physically.

What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him. The prisoner who lost faith in the future was doomed. With loss of belief in the future, people lose their spiritual hold and become subject to mental and physical decay. The book has sold over 16 million copies and is considered one of the most influential books of the twentieth century.
